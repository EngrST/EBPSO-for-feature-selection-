This work presents an enhanced particle swarm optimization employed for feature selection to tackle the limitations of the current version of binary BPSO. Its primary quality is the application of a position update mechanism to appropriately select optimal features. The position update mechanism is designed to avoid the premature convergence issue suffered by BPSO, by determining the probability of the particles switching positions using position values rather than velocity.
